Homotopy Type Theory and categorical algebra experiments in the style of UniMath

This repository is based on code developed by [Ettore Aldrovandi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov) for a graduate introductory course on Homotopy Type Theory held at Florida State University, coded [MAS5932](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/teaching/2020-21/fall/MAS5932/index.html), hence the name.

It evolved into a playground to experiment with theorems in Univalent Mathematics, in particular algebraic structures and categorical algebra.

Current development is happening in Martín Escardó's [TypeTopology](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology), which is also forked [here](https://github.com/ettorealdrovandi/TypeTopology).
